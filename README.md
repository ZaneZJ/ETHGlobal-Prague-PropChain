# 🏙️ PropChain: Tokenize, Rent, and Invest in Real Estate on Ethereum

## 🚀 What is PropChain?

PropChain is a next-generation dApp that transforms real estate into a liquid, borderless, and programmable asset. We fractionalize iconic properties (think Dubai penthouses, Prague lofts, and more) into ERC-1155 tokens, letting anyone invest, trade, and earn from real estate with just a few clicks and a crypto wallet.

## 💡 Why PropChain?

- Fractional ownership: Own a piece of prime real estate for the price of a coffee. No banks, no borders, no paperwork.
- On-Chain rental contracts: Generate, sign, and manage rental agreements as smart contracts. Rent flows, deposits, and even maintenance are all transparent and automated.
- AI-Powered contracts: Upload your rental agreement template, fill in details, and let our OpenAI-powered assistant generate a ready-to-sign contract PDF — in seconds.
- Real Estate chatbot: Got questions about property, taxes, or investment? Our AI assistant is always on, always smart, and always blockchain-savvy.
- Seamless UX: Connect your wallet, view your tokenized assets, transfer tokens, and manage contracts — all in a beautiful, modern interface.

## 🌍 The Vision

We’re building the DeFi of Real Estate — a world where property is as programmable and accessible as any ERC-20 token, and where anyone, anywhere, can invest, rent, and build wealth on-chain.
